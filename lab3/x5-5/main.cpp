/*x5-5
Use multiple headers for one image. Load an image
that is at least 100x100. Create two additional
headers that are ROIs where width=20 and the height=30.
Their origins should be at (5,10) and (50,60), respectively.
Pass these new image sub-headers to cv::bitwise_not().
Display the loaded image, which should have two inverted
rectangles within the larger image.
